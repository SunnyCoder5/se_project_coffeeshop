# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- in the Header section adding location and map near the paragraph with adress of coffeeshop
- in the Header section adding a link and logo corresponding to the web-site of Tripleten Library
- It would be useful to add form for making an order remotely in addition of table boking
